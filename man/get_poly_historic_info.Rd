}
\arguments{
\item{ticker}{Specify which symbol you want to call by inserting ticker as a string.}

\item{\code{success} \code{(logical)} If this query was executed successfully}
\item{\code{ticker} \code{(character)} Ticker symbol that was evaluated from the request}
\item{\code{results_count} \code{(integer)} Total number of results in this response}
\item{\code{db_latency} \code{(integer)} Milliseconds of latency for the query results from DB}
